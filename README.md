# **Disease Prediction App ðŸ©º**

The **Disease Prediction App** is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict potential diseases based on selected symptoms. Using a trained model, it provides a user-friendly interface for individuals to input their symptoms and get predictions instantly.

---

## **Features**

- **Symptom Selection**: Users can choose from a list of symptoms to indicate what they are experiencing.
- **Disease Prediction**: The app uses a machine learning model to predict the most likely disease.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with **Gradio**, it offers an intuitive and modern interface.
- **Fast and Accurate**: Provides predictions in real-time based on a pre-trained model.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Input Symptoms**: Select the symptoms that best describe what you are experiencing.
2. **Model Prediction**: The app processes the input through a trained ML model.
3. **Get Results**: The predicted disease is displayed instantly.

> **Note**: This tool is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Backend programming language.
- **Gradio**: For building the web interface.
- **Pandas**: For data processing.
- **Joblib**: For loading the trained machine learning model.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training the machine learning model (logistic regression).
